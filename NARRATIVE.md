# Narrative Strategy: Countering Zero-Sum Thinking

## Part 1: Defining the Positive-Sum Economy

**Core Theory:** Comparative Advantage
- Specialization creates NEW wealth — the pie expands, not redistributes
- Diverse, skilled workforce = more innovation, productivity, and market creation
- Immigration adds complementary skills, filling gaps rather than displacing workers
- Key proof: Every major U.S. economic expansion coincided with immigration waves

## Part 2: Understanding Zero-Sum Rhetoric (Non-Partisan Analysis)

**Why Politicians Promote Restrictive Policies:**
- Short-term electoral incentive: Fear-based messaging consolidates voting blocs
- Easier to blame outsiders than address complex structural economic issues
- Zero-sum framing appeals to loss aversion psychology

**Key Terms to Use (Objective, Non-Partisan):**
- 'Politicians seeking short-term electoral gains'
- 'Factions promoting nativist-protectionist views'
- 'Rhetoric prioritizing divisiveness over broad-based growth'

## Part 3: Historical Contrast — Lessons from Protectionism vs. Openness

**Zero-Sum Era (Mercantilist Policies):**
- Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930): Raised tariffs → global trade collapsed → Great Depression deepened
- Immigration Act of 1924: Quota system → labor shortages, slowed industrial expansion

**Positive-Sum Era (Globalized, Open Policies):**
- Post-WWII immigration reform → tech boom, Silicon Valley emergence
- 1965 Immigration Act → skilled worker influx → U.S. innovation dominance
- Conclusion: Openness correlates with expansion; restriction correlates with contraction
